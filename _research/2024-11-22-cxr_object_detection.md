title: "Deep Learning-Based Object Detection Strategies for Disease Detection and Localization in Chest X-Ray Images"
collection: research
category: manuscripts
permalink: /research/cxr_object_detection
excerpt: 'This paper presents deep learning-based object detection for automatically identifying abnormal regions in Chest X-ray (CXR) images. We developed models using disease-labeled images and location bounding boxes from E-Da Hospital. We assessed the impact of background image proportions on model performance and explored few-shot object detection techniques. Our results show that background proportions significantly affect model inference, and CNN-based models outperform Transformer-based models in all scenarios. This system improves the efficiency and reliability of automated CXR image analysis.'
